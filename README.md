# ReactMonitorFlow
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Waterway monitoring can be a difficult task without a proper set of equipment. Ideally, the equipment used for monitoring should be lightweight and should have long battery life; Internet of Things (IoT) matches these criteria perfectly for waterway monitoring.

Zigbee network devices will be used in this project which implement a mesh type network. End devices to act as sensors, routers route information in the network, and coordinators establish and manage the network. The ‘ZigFlo’ project aims to effectively reduce the workload strain on waterway measurement specialists.

For easy access on the logged parameters, the information is sent to a web page interface for the user to view the data in a readable and interactive manner without having to visit the waterway site. The measured water parameter information that was sent from each sensor was continuously sent to and  monitored from the web User Interface (UI).
